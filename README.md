# Holberton School â€” Shell Projects

This repository contains my work for the Holberton School shell curriculum. Over the past week(s), Iâ€™ve focused on shell scripting, input/output redirection, filters, and file permissions. This is a work in progress and part of my growth as a system programmer.

## ðŸ›  What Iâ€™ve Done This Week

- Created and practiced small shell scripts in the **basics** directory  
- Worked with **I/O redirections and filters** (stdin, stdout, `|`, `>`, `<`)  
- Learned and applied **file permissions** (read, write, execute), `chmod`, `ls -l`  
- Tested scripts, debugging errors, and making them more robust  
- Added a helper script: `gitautomafile.sh` for automating commits (?)
